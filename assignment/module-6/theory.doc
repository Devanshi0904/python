MODULE – 6 :  
 

Que - 1. Introduction to Python and Its Features 


1. History and Evolution of Python 

-  Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language. It is a simple and easy to understand language which feels like reading simple English

➢ Features: 
• Easy to understand = Less development time  
• Free and open source 
• High level language 
• Portable: Works on Linux / Windows / Mac. 
• Fun to work with!
 
➢ History and evolution:- 
•	1989 – Created by Guido van Rossum. 
•	1991 – First version (Python 0.9.0) released. 
•	2000 – Python 2.0 introduced list comprehensions, garbage collection. 
•	2008 – Python 3.0 launched with better design (not backward-compatible). 
•	2025 – Python 3.x is used in AI, ML, web development, automation, and many more areas. 
 

2. Advantages of Python Over Other Languages 

•	Easy syntax and fast to develop. 
•	Strong community and huge library support. 
•	Used in various domains (web, AI, data science). 
•	Platform independent. 
•	Integration support with C/C++/Java. 
 

3. Installing Python & Setting Up Environment 

-	Anaconda – Best for data science; includes Python, Jupyter, etc. 
-	PyCharm – Full IDE for Python. 
-	VS Code – Lightweight editor; install Python extension. 
 

4. First Python Program

Code: 
print("Hello, world!") 
 


Que - 2. Programming Style 

1. PEP 8 Guidelines 

- PEP 8 is Python’s official style guide.As per PEP 8 the following are the guideline which must be followed while writing python code. 
•	Use 4 spaces per indent. 
•	Limit lines to 79 characters. 
•	Function/variable names must be snake_case instead of  ‘a’  or ‘user’. 
•	Class names must be ‘CamelCase’ instead of ‘camel’  
•	Add whitespace around operators. 


2. Indentation, Comments, Naming 

•	Indentation: Mandatory (4 spaces). 
•	Comments: Use # for single-line and """ for docstrings or multiple line comments. 
•	Naming: Use meaningful names, follow snake_case. 
 

3. Writing Readable & Maintainable Code 

•	Follow PEP 8. 
•	Write small, modular functions. 
•	Use docstrings and comments. 
•	Avoid deep nesting. 
•	Choose descriptive variable names. 
 

Que - 3. Core Python Concepts

1. Data Types 
- datatype specifies what type of data a variable can store such as intger , floating , character etc...

•   int: 5 
•	float: 3.14 
•	str: "Hello" 
•	list: [1, 2, 3] 
•	tuple: (1, 2) 
•	dict: {'a': 1} 
•	set: {1, 2, 3} 
 
2. Variables & Memory Allocation 

•	Python variables are references to objects. 
•	Memory is managed automatically using reference counting and garbage collection. 
 
3. Operators 

•	Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %, // 
•	Comparison: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <= 
•	Logical: and, or, not 
•	Bitwise: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >> 


Que - 4. Conditional Statements 

1. if, else, elif 

•	if: Checks a condition. If it's True, executes a block of code. 
•	elif (else-if): Checks another condition if the first if was False. 
•	else: Runs if none of the above conditions are True. 

- CODE: 
if x > 0: 
    print("Positive number") elif x == 0: 
    print("Zero") else: 
    print("Negative number") 
 

2. Nested if-else 

if x > 0:     if x < 10: 
        print("Small positive number") 
    else: 
        print("Large number") 


Que - 5. Looping 

1. for & while Loops 

for i in range(5):    
print(i) while x < 5:   
print(x) 
    x += 1 
 
2. How Loops Work

•	for: Iterates over a sequence. 
•	while: Runs while a condition is True. 
 
3. Loops with Collections

for item in [1, 2, 3]:     
print(item) for key in my_dict: 
    print(key, my_dict[key]) 
 

Que - 8. Control Statements 

1. break, continue, pass 
 
-   break: Exits loop 
-	continue: Skips current iteration 
-	pass: Does nothing (placeholder) 


Que - 9. String Manipulation 

1. Accessing and Manipulating Strings s = "Python" print(s[0])  # P print(s[-1])  # n 


2. Basic Operations 

"Hello" + "World"   # Concatenation 
"Hi" * 3            # Repetition 
s.upper(), s.lower() 


3. String Slicing Example s = "Python" print(s[0:2])  # Py print(s[::2])  # Pto
