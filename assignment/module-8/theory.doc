MODULE - 7 :  
 

Que - 1  Printing on Screen

1. Introduction to the print() function in Python.
- The print() function in Python is used to display output on the screen. It prints the specified message, variable, or value to the console.

o Example:
	 
	print("Hello, World!")


2.   Formatting outputs using f-strings and format().
* F-Strings :

	f"Hello, {name}!"	

- Fast, readable, supports expressions & format specs.

o Example:
	print(f"Pi: {3.14159:.2f}")

* format() Method:

"Hello, {}".format(name)

- Uses {} placeholders (positional/named).

o Example:
	print("Balance: ${:,.2f}".format(12345.67))



Que - 2  Reading Data from Keyboard

1. Using the input() function to read user input from the keyboard. 
- The input() function is used in Python to get input from the user via the keyboard. It always returns the input as a string (text), even if the user types a number.
 
* Syntax: 
variable = input("Prompt message") 

o Example:
name = input("Enter your name: ") 
print("Hello,", name) 

2. Converting user input into different data types (e.g., int, float, etc.).
- Converting user input into different data types means changing the input (which is always a string) into another type like int, float, etc

o Example:

# integer input
Age = int(input(�enter your age�))
print("Next year, you will be", age + 1)
 
# float input
price = float(input("Enter the price: ")) 
print("Price with tax:", price * 1.1)

# Boolean input
	x = input("Enter something: ")   
       b = bool(x)                      
       print(b)
       
       
Que - 3   Opening and Closing Files
1. Opening files in different modes ('r', 'w', 'a', 'r+', 'w+').
- When working with files in Python, the open() function is used along with a mode that tells Python what you want to do with the file. 

* Mode Description
'r'  :  Read mode (default).
'w' :  ' Write mode.
'a'  :  Append mode.
'r+ :  Read and write. 
'w+' Write and read. 

* Examples: 
# 'r' - read only 
f = open('file.txt', 'r') 

# 'w' - write only, creates or overwrites 
f = open('file.txt', 'w') 

# 'a' - append only 
f = open('file.txt', 'a') 

# 'r+' - read and write (no overwrite) 
f = open('file.txt', 'r+') 

# 'w+' - write and read (with overwrite) 
f = open('file.txt', 'w+')   
 
 
2. Using the open() function to create and access files.
- The open() function in Python is used to create, read, write, or append to a file. Its basic syntax is:
- file = open('filename', 'mode') 
- After opening a file, you can use: 
* read() : to read content, 
* write() : to write to the file, 
* close() : to close the file. 

o Example: 
# Create and write to a file 
file = open('example.txt', 'w') 
file.write("Hello, this is a test file.") 
file.close() 

o Example: 
file = open('example.txt', 'r') 
content = file.read() 
print(content) 
file.close()

o Example: 
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file: 
    print(file.read()) 
# Automatically closes the file


3. Closing files using close().
- The close() method is used to close a file in Python after you are done working with it. This frees up system resources and ensures that any changes are saved.

o Example:
file = open("example.txt", "r")
content = file.read()
file.close()  # closes the file



Que -  4   Reading and Writing Files
1. Reading from a file using read(), readline(), readlines().
o read() : Reads the entire file as a single string.
	content = f.read()
- Use when you need the whole file at once.

o readline() : Reads one line at a time (including \n).
	line = f.readline()
- Use for sequential line-by-line reading.

o readlines() :Reads all lines into a list.
	lines = f.readlines()
-  Use when you need to loop through lines easily.

2. Writing to a file using write() and writelines().
o write() : writes a single string to a file.
	with open("file.txt", "w") as f:
	f.write("Hello\nWorld")
-  Writes exactly what�s in the string.

o writelines() : writes a list (or iterable) of strings to a file.
	with open("file.txt", "w") as f:
    f.writelines(["Hello\n", "World\n"])
                -  It does not add newline characters automatically � you must include \n if needed.




Que - 5  Exception Handling
1. Introduction to exceptions and how to handle them using try, except, and finally.
• Syntax: 
try: 
# risky code 
       except ErrorType: 
       # handle error 
finally: 
       # always runs 

• Example: 
try: 
         x = 5 / 0 
except ZeroDivisionError: 
        print("Can't divide by zero!") 
finally: 
        print("Done!")


2. Understanding multiple exceptions and custom exceptions.
• Handling Multiple Exceptions: 
   try: 
       value = int("abc") 
           except ValueError: 
       print("Value error!") 
           except TypeError: 
       print("Type error!") 

• Catching Multiple Errors Together: 
except (ValueError, TypeError): 
    print("Either a ValueError or TypeError occurred.") 

• Custom Exception: 
class TooSmallError(Exception): 
        pass 
def check(n): 
     if n < 10: 
       raise TooSmallError("Number too small") 
       try: 
              check(5) 
       except TooSmallError as e: 
              print("Error:", e)



Que – 6   Class and Object (OOP Concepts)
1. Understanding the concepts of classes, objects, attributes, and methods in Python.
• Class  :  A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior.
class Car:
pass

• Object  :  An instance of a class (a specific example created from the blueprint).
my_car = Car()

• Attributes → Variables inside a class that store data or properties of an object.
class Car 
         def __init__(self, brand, color):
        self.brand = brand
        self.color = color

• Methods → Functions defined inside a class that describe the behavior of an object.
class Car:
    def start(self):
        print("Car is starting...")



2. Difference between local and global variables.
i. Local Variable 
• Defined inside a function 
• Accessible only within that function 
• Example: 
def greet(): 
name = "Alice" # local variable 
print(name) 

ii. Global Variable 
• Defined outside any function 
• Can be accessed anywhere in the program 
• Example: 
name = "Bob"        # global variable
def greet(): 
   print(name) 
    greet()         # can access global variable


Que – 7   Inheritance
1. Single, Multilevel, Multiple, Hierarchical, and Hybrid inheritance in Python.
• Single Inheritance
- A child class inherits from one parent class.
• Example :
class A:
   def show(self):
     print("A")

class B(A):
	   pass

b = B()
b.show()  # Output: A

• Multilevel Inheritance
- Inheritance occurs across multiple levels.
• Example :
class A:
    pass
class B(A):
    pass
class C(B):
    pass
Here, C inherits from B, and B inherits from A.

• Multiple Inheritance
- A class inherits from more than one parent class.
• Example :
class A:
    pass
class B:
   pass
class C(A, B):
   pass
- C gets features from both A and B.

• Hierarchical Inheritance
- Multiple child classes inherit from the same parent class.
class A:
    pass
class B(A):
   pass
class C(A):
    pass

• Hybrid Inheritance
- Combination of two or more types of inheritance.
class A: pass
class B(A): pass
class C(A): pass
class D(B, C): pass          # Hybrid (multiple + hierarchical)



2. Using the super() function to access properties of the parent class.
- The super() function in Python is used to access methods and properties from a parent (super) class inside a child class. It helps avoid directly naming the parent class and supports multiple inheritance.
• Example:
class Parent:
   def greet(self):
        print("Hello from Parent")

class Child(Parent):
    def greet(self):
        super().greet()   # calls Parent's greet()
        print("Hello from Child")

c = Child()
c.greet()


Que – 8   Method Overloading and Overriding
1. Method overloading: defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.]
• Method Overloading: 
- Method Overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. 
o In some languages like Java, this is done by changing the number/type of arguments. 
o But in Python, true method overloading is not directly supported because Python methods can accept any number of arguments using *args and **kwargs. 
- This works because Python uses default arguments or *args to mimic overloading. 

• Simulating Method Overloading in Python 
class Greet: 
   def hello(self, name=None): 
   if name: 
   print(f"Hello, {name}!") 
else: 
       print("Hello!") 
      		g = Greet() 
       g.hello()                      # Output: Hello!
       g.hello("devanshi")          # Output: Hello, devanshi!

2. Method overriding: redefining a parent class method in the child class.
• Method Overridding:
- Method Overriding means redefining a method from the parent class in the child class to provide a different implementation. 

• Example: 
     	class Animal: 
   def speak(self): 
       print("Animal makes a sound") 
class Dog(Animal): 
         def speak(self):      # overriding the method 
       print("Dog barks") 
d = Dog() 
d.speak()           # Output: Dog barks 
• Using super() with Overriding 
- You can still call the parent version of the overridden method using super(): 

• Example: 
class Dog(Animal): 	
         def speak(self): 
       super().speak() 
       print("Dog barks") 
       d = Dog() 
       d.speak()


Que – 9   SQLite3 and PyMySQL (Database Connectors)
1. Introduction to SQLite3 and PyMySQL for database connectivity.
• SQLite3 :
- SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, self-contained SQL database engine. 
- It stores the entire database in a single file on the disk. 
- Ideal for small to medium applications, prototyping, or embedded systems. 
- Python has a built-in module sqlite3 for connecting and interacting with SQLite databases. 
• Example: 
- import sqlite3 
# Connect to a database (or create one if it doesn't exist) 
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db') 
cursor = conn.cursor() 
# Create a table 
cursor.execute('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (id INTEGER, name TEXT)') 
# Commit and close 
conn.commit() 
conn.close() 

• PyMySQL :
- PyMySQL is a third-party library used to connect Python with MySQL databases. 
- Suitable for web applications, large datasets, and multi-user environments. 
- Requires the MySQL server to be installed and running. 

• Example: 
import pymysql 
# Connect to MySQL 
conn = pymysql.connect ( host='localhost',
user='root', 
password='yourpassword', 
database='testdb' ) 
cursor = conn.cursor() 
       # Create a table 
       cursor.execute('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (id INT, name VARCHAR(100))') 
       # Commit and close 
       conn.commit() 
       conn.close() 


2. Creating and executing SQL queries from Python using these connectors.
• Install:
pip install mysql-connector-python

• Example:
import mysql.connector

# Connect to the MySQL database
connection = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="root",
    password="yourpassword",
    database="testdb"
)

cursor = connection.cursor()

# Create table
cursor.execute("""
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    salary FLOAT
)
""")

# Insert data
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO employees (name, salary) VALUES (%s, %s)", ("John Doe", 50000))
connection.commit()

# Fetch data
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM employees")
for row in cursor.fetchall():
    print(row)

cursor.close()
connection.close()


Que – 10  Search and Match Functions
1. Using re.search() and re.match() functions in Python’s re module for pattern matching.
- re.match() checks for a match only at the beginning of the string.

import re
re.match("cat", "catfish")   
re.match("cat", "concatenate")  
- re.search() checks for a match anywhere in the string.
re.search("cat", "concatenate")  
re.search("cat", "dog")  
        
• re.match() → beginning of string only.
• re.search() → anywhere in the string.


2. Difference between search and match.
• re.match() checks for a match only at the beginning of the string. If the pattern doesn’t appear right at the start, it returns None.
• re.search(), on the other hand, scans the entire string and returns the first match it finds, no matter where it appears.
